# Card-Matching-Game
This mini project is a simple card matching game that is built to scale with various kinds of cards using OOP. For now it works
with just Playing Cards and Set Cards. Some key API in the foundation framework, use of introspection, attributed strings, view
controller lifecycle, proper adherence to MVC, navigation/tabbed bar/generic view controllers, and polymorphism with view controllers
are some of the things that were put together to build this app. The code with continue to be refactored to be more maintainable,
efficient and readable. More features will also be added over time.
